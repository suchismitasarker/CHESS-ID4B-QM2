# Welcome to CHESS ID4B - QM2 Beamline Documentation!

The QM2 beamline is optimized to uncover intertwined quantum correlations of spins, charges and orbitals, over a wide temperature range and spanning entire phase diagrams. Here is the [CHESS ID4 QM2 Documentation](https://suchismitasarker.github.io/CHESS-ID4B-QM2/).

This documents is a collection of codes usefull for the beamline ID4B at CHESS. If you encounter with any bug or like to have additional functionality, please submit an issue.
