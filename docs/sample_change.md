# Sample change 

The procedure of mounting/changing the sample depends on the type of experiment performed ID4B.

##### Magnetic mount for the single crystal

The powder samples on single-crystal mounts are straightforward. Using a drop of oil, the powder sample sticks to the magnetic base or standard mounts under the microscope.
