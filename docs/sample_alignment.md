##### Basic Theory - HDRM

The High Dynamic Range Mapping (HDRM) is primarily a method for studying single crystal samples, although it can also be effective for studying thin films. The aim of HDRM is to rapidly study wide regions of reciprocal space, collecting the intense Bragg peaks required to refine crystal structures along with weak features associated with superstructures, and the slowly modulated scattering associated with phonons and short-range order[[1](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/srn-article-cartography-7-dimensions-chess)].
