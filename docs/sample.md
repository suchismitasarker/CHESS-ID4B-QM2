# Sample change 

The procedure of mounting/changing the sample depends on the type of experiment performed ID4B.


### Sample mount (single crystal)

The single-crystal mounts are straightforward. 

Step 1: You need magnetic mount 



Step 2 : Micromount 


Step 3: GE Varnish


Step 4: Use GE vernish to glue the micromount to magnetic mount 


Step 5 : 
Using GE vernish at the top of the Mincromount and attached the sample properly. 
Make sure you do not tunch the metal part with the sample!!
