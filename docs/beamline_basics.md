#### Where to check the CESR, Ion chamber 1 (IC1) , ion chamber 2 (IC2) and diode values?

* Make sure where you need you understand when the beam is in the hutch 
* You will have different vales (please check your google doc)
* If you see your diode values (showed in your google doc) are very different, contact beamline scientist
