<i> Huber “psi” diffractometer is installed at CHESS ID4B. Due to four sample-orientation axes and two detector-orientation axes, the psi-circle diffractometer is also known as “4S+2D". The independent motion sample and detector orientation provide nine degrees of freedom to define any vertical diffraction plane.The angle calculations for this diffractometer were shown in the reference [1] [2]. The motor names are shown below in Table 1.
