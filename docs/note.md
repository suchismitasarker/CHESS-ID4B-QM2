#### Check 1: Ensure IC1, IC2, and Diode values are stable. Talk to the beamline scientist and please follow the steps: [<b>Click here </b>](https://suchismitasarker.github.io/CHESS-ID4B-QM2/IC1_signal/)
#### Check 2: Frequently check the raw data in NexPy.
#### Check 3: Ensure the temperature folder contains only 3 scans.
#### Check 4: Do not leave the beamline in helium conditions overnight—consult with the beamline scientist.
#### Check 5: Be patient with temperature changes; it takes time.
#### Check 6: If ice forms, increase the temperature to remove it.
