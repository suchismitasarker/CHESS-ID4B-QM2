# Welcome to CHESS QM2 Beamline Documentation!

The QM2 beamline is optimized to uncover intertwined quantum correlations of spins, charges and orbitals, over a wide temperature range and spanning entire phase diagrams. For full documentation of beamline capabilities, please visit [QM2 beamline](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/users/qm2-beamline).

This documents is a collection of codes usefull for the beamline ID4B at CHESS. If you encounter with any bug or like to have additional functionality, please submit an issue.
