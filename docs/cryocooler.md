The cryocooler is manufectured by [CYRO Industries of America, Inc.](http://www.cryoindustries.com/).

<i> Close-circle cryostats is installed in &#60QM&#62<sup>2</sup> allows samples to be comprehensively studied wide range of temperature from 12K to 500K. The cryocooler can operate both helium (12K to 300K) and nitrogen gas (300K to 500K ) using a single stream flow. In-hourse nitrogen and helium gas is used for cryo cooler. Just swiching the knob outside of the hutch, the gas supply can be altered. 

The external tip-heater prevent to frost and maintain a dry tip that helps to create ice-free sample environmant at low temperature. A platinum temperature sensor is installed to control the low alarm setting temperature that trigger back the temperature controller to energized and maintain the ice-free enviroment. 

The main component of the cryostate can be devided into five deferent components: 
<br>

* (i) <b> source </b> : the refregator or the cryostate act as a source to cool a relable cryogenic temperature for a long continuous periods
<br>

* (ii)<b> compressor </b>
<br>

* (iii) <b> PID temperature controller </b>: Cryogenic temperature controlled Model 336 manufectured by Lake Shore is used.  The controller’s zone tuning feature allows you to measure and control temperatures seamlessly from 300 mK to over 1,500 K by automatically switching temperature sensor inputs [1].
<br>

* (iv) <b> Power supply </b> : 30 V digital and 24V DC is used
<br> 

* (v) <b> Gas flow controller </b> : The digital flow automatically control and deplays the flow rate

<b> Gas flow parameters </b>
<br>
<b> Helium gas </b>: Normal flow rate is between 8 – 12 liters/min, typically 11 l/min
</br>
<b> Nitrogen gas </b> : Normal flow rate is between 8 – 12 liters/min, typically 9 l/min.
</br>

<b> Safety </b>

* Do not touch the cold helium and nitrogen gas stream. Exposure to skin of the cold gas could result in a severe injuries.
* The dewar system has pressure relief protection installed. Do not remove pressure reliefs or check valves.
