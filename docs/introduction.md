The layout of the CHESS ID4B beamline is shown in the figure above. For more details see the beamline paper (soon to be published). 

This document is categorized into three sections. 

* [<b><u><i>User Guide :</i> </b> </u>](https://suchismitasarker.github.io/CHESS-ID4B-QM2/#) This is the most useful section for the ID4B beamline users. Here, the users can gather information about SPEC commands to run their samples in the beamline. This includes sample alignment details and data analysis steps. In addition, this section also includes information on the beamline equipment.



* [<b><u><i>Admin documents</i> </b> </u>](https://suchismitasarker.github.io/CHESS-ID4B-QM2/beamline_setup/) : This section is used for administrative purposes. However, you can find information about proposal details, and computational configurations (nomachine and globus setup) in the beamline setup section.


* [<b><u><i>Frequently Ask Questions (FAQ) </i> </b> </u>](https://suchismitasarker.github.io/CHESS-ID4B-QM2/FAQ/) :   This section includes FAQs in the beamline before, during, and after the run.
